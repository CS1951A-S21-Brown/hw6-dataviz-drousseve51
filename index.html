    <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-left: 50px;">Written Questions: <br>
        1. I answered question 1 by showing the number of titles per genre in a bar graph, focusing on the top 15 genres.
        I answered question 2 by showing the median runtimes of movies per year in a box and whisker plot. I answered
        question 3 by showing a network graph of actors, with links referring to movies and shows that the actors starred in together.<br>
        2. D3 was really helpful in creating the scales for the x and y axes of my graphs, for calculating the quartiles
        used in the box and whisker plot, and for creating the force directed graph of actors.<br>
        3. D3 can be a bad tool for visualization because it can be more complicated/complex than necessary for simple
        visualizations. It also requires very specific data structuring to create some of the more complex graphs,
        making it difficult to debug. D3 also can't load multiple datasets at once, so preprocessing/joining has to be
        done before working with it.<br>
        4. My dashboard is easily accessible for people without difficulties seeing, and for people who use the keyboard
        and mouse in a traditional way. It is less accessible for people who are blind, or potentially those with epilepsy.
        Why Accessibility is at the Heart of Data Visualization states: "If youâ€™re using animation, factor in people
        with epilepsy, ADHD, or cognitive disabilities, and give the user control of the animation." One action I could
        take to put this idea into action would be to allow the user to control the animation of the network graph, or
        even access an alternative representation of the data. I could also change the color scheme of the moving parts
        of the animation, to lessen the visual strain that could create problems for people with epilepsy.<br>
        5. I could have added more control to the animation, or even given the data nodes the appropriate tags so that
        they could be 'tabbed' through, but due to my inexperience with Javascript and D3, I didn't know how to build in
        these accessibility features. With more experience, I believe I could have implemented these ideas and the ones
        I mentioned in question 4. Additionally, my initial and primary focus was providing an interesting representation of the data
        rather than ensuring that the representation was open to everyone; by changing this focus, or placing the same
        importance on them, I could create better, more accessible data visualizations.<br>
        Stats Extra Credit: I made a box and whisker plot for the average runtimes of movies by year graph, this is statistical
        because it shows the median, maximum, minimum, and quartiles for the data. <br>
        Flow Extra Credit: I made a force directed network graph of actors, with links representing titles shared between
        pairs of actors.
